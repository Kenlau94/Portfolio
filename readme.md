Personal Portfolio
This week we had to create a personal profile and upload it to github. Our portfolio is an extension of ourselves and represents what we can do. Still familiarizing myself with css and html format, this took me a couple days to complete, but I am quite proud of what I came up with. First, I began with the basic html layout and then adding sections and content. Linking the css page to the html, I began to add background pictures to the sections and editted the visual layouts of the html. Whenever I would get stuck, I went back into previous assignments to compare with my current work. The only thing that took me a while to do was to link the github pages to the images. I followed the criteria listed below:

<!--GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport>-->
